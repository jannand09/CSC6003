Create a battleship game with a 2D array

delcare global grid as a list
declare global variable for grid size
declare global variable for number of ships in the game

function drawBoard(array)
	print the labels for columns
	loop through the array
		print the label for the row
		loop through a list in the array
			print the elements of the list into the current row
		print a new line to prepare to start the next row
		
function setupBoard()
	create variables for number of rows and columns needed
	use nested for loops to create 2D array of dots
	use for loop to get 5 ships in the 2D array
		create infinite while loop
			set row number to random integer
			set column number to random integer
			if grid[row number][column number] is not already a ship
				make that element in the 2D array a ship
				break from the while loop to create the next ship
				
function isGameOver()
	create variable that counts sunken ships
	create nested for loops
		check if each element is a sunken ship
			add 1 to the sunken ship variable if the element is a sunken ship
			
	check if the sunken ship variable is equal to number of ships

function checkHitOrMiss(row, col, arr)
	if the element equal to arr[row][col] is a ship
		chnage element to sunk ship "X"
		print "HIT"
	else
		change element to a miss "O"
		print "MISS"
		
function main()
	call the setupBoard function
	call the drawBoard fucntion with grid variable as argument
	
	create loop that continues while isGameOver() function is false
		ask user for row
		ask user for column
		call checkHitOrMiss function for row column and grid
		call drawBoard function to show user the board again
		
		if there is an IndexError
			ask user to enter integers from 0 to 9
		if there is a NameError
			ask user to enter only integers
			
	print "GAME OVER!" once loop exits
	
	
call the main function
