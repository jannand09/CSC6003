According to the results above, the Merge sort algorithm is better than the Bubble sort algorithm. The time stamps show that the Merge sort is faster for each random list. 
The difference in time taken to sort the list with each algorithm increases as the number of list elements grows. The time taken to sort a list of 10 elementsis miniscule; 
however, the disparity in time taken to sort 100,000 elements is immense. The Merge sort took less than 38 seconds while the Bubble sort had not successfully sorted the list after 2 hours.
